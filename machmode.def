/* The first argument is the internal name of the machine mode
   used in the C source.
   By convention these are in UPPER_CASE, except for the lower case "mode".

   The second argument  is the name of the machine mode in the
   external ASCII format read by for both the rtl and tree.
   By convention these names in UPPER_CASE.

   Third argument states the kind of representation:
   0 - none
   1 - unsigned int
   2 - signed int
   3 - float
   4+n - complex whatever
   8+n - bit field 

   16 and up - pointer
   16 is normal pointer
   17 is special bit-field pointer
   18 is relative pointer.

   Fourth argument is the size of the object, in bytes.
   It is zero when the size is meaningless or not determined.

   Fifth arg is size of subunits of the object, in bytes.
   It is same as 4 except for complexes and EPmode,
   since they are really made of two equal size subunits.  */
