This directory contains the initial test release of the GNU C compiler.
Although it has compiled some large programs correctly, it probably
has many remaining bugs that only much use by many people will detect.

See the file internals.texinfo for installation and porting information.

The GNU C compiler is free software.  See the file COPYING for copying
permission.
